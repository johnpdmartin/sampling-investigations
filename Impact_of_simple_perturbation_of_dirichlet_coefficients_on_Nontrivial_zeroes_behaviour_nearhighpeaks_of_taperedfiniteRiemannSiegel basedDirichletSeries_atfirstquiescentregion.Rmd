##Executive Summary

An investigation of the non-trivial zero behaviour about five known large Riemann Zeta function peaks at t={363991205.178, 673297382.184, 1387123309.985, 2381374874120.454, 4257232978148261.802} for a simple perturbation of the dirichlet coefficients of tapered finite Dirichlet Series of the zeroth order Riemann Siegel formula is reported. The distinctive non-trivial zero behaviour under simple perturbation nearby these particular large peaks appears related to non-trivial zeroes of the Riemann Zeta function with $|S| \gtrsim 1.7$. The same behaviour is observed for the (more accurate approximation of the Riemann Zeta function given by the) tapered finite Dirichlet Series truncated at the second quiescent region for smaller Riemann Zeta function peaks occurring nearby the first three Rosser rule violations.  

##Introduction

The tapered finite Dirichlet Series truncated about the second quiescent region  in the final plateau of the oscillatory divergence of such dirichlet series provides a useful approximation of the mean value of the infinite series sum (i.e., averaging out the oscillatory divergence) [1-4]. Perturbation of such an series approximation function about the second quiescent region provides access to complex plane functions that encompasses lower symmetry than the L functions.

In this paper, the non-trivial zero behaviour of a simple perturbation of the dirichlet coefficients of the Riemann Zeta function [5-8] that does not change the location of the second (and first) quiescent region and (in the oscillatory divergence of Riemann Zeta Dirichlet Series) is investigated for the tapered zeroth order Riemann Siegel function. Perturbation of the zeroth order Riemann Siegel function is attempted to allow (much faster calculation of the) approximate estimates of the lower symmetry behaviour of non-trivial zeroes nearby large Riemann Zeta peaks with heights 100-850.

## A simple perturbation of the Riemann Zeta function to produce lower symmetry behaviour

A simple perturbation of the Rieman Zeta function can be achieved by the modified function


\begin{equation}
\zeta(s,\alpha)_{\text{pert}} = (1-\alpha) + \alpha \cdot \zeta(s)
\end{equation}

The impact of the perturbation is that the symmetry of the function is lowered (compared to the Riemann Zeta function) and non-trivial zeroes can be observed away from the critical line (where in the unmodified function none have been observed to occur).

This perturbation was one of two perturbations examined in [9] where the Riemann Zeta function was approximated by the finite Riemann Zeta Dirichlet Series truncated at the second quiescent region $N=\frac{t}{\pi}$ which is a useful approximation (of the Riemann Zeta function) away from the real axis. The use of the Dirichlet Series approximation allowed first principles calculation of the first and second derivatives of the complex function with respect to the real and imaginary components ($s=\sigma + I \cdot t$) necessary for quadrature based searches of non-trivial zero locations and hence trajectories under perturbation. In terms of the Dirichlet Series the above perturbation can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\zeta(s,\alpha)_{\text{pert}} \approx (1-\alpha) + \alpha \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{\left(\lfloor\frac{t}{\pi}\rfloor\right)}\left(\frac{1}{k^s}\right) = 1 + \alpha \cdot \sum_{k=2}^{\left(\lfloor\frac{t}{\pi}\rfloor\right)}\left(\frac{1}{k^s}\right)
\end{equation}

using truncation at the second quiescent region $N=\frac{t}{\pi}$ to allow approximation of the Riemann Zeta function when $\sigma \le 1$.

To achieve a more accurate approximation of perturbation of the Riemann Zeta function (away from the real axis) when $\sigma \le 1$, a 128 tapered finite Riemann Zeta Dirichlet Series truncated at the second quiescent region $N=\frac{t}{\pi}$ is available

\begin{align}
\zeta(s,\alpha)_{\text{pert}} &\approx 1 + \alpha \cdot \left [ \sum_{k=2}^{\left(\lfloor\frac{t}{\pi}\rfloor-p\right)}\left(\frac{1}{k^s}\right) +
\sum_{i=\left(-p+1\right)}^{p}\frac{\frac{1}{2^{2p}} \left( 2^{2p}-\sum_{k=0}^{i+p-1}\binom{2p}{2p-k}\right)}{(\lfloor\frac{t}{\pi}\rfloor+i)^s} \right ]  \qquad \text{as } t \rightarrow \infty \label {eq:pertubationONEtaperedDiricihletSeries} 
\end{align}

where 2p=128 (for 128 point tapering) which is used in this paper. Results using the above expression are given in the appendix for t < 14,254,000 nearby the first three Rosser rule violations [10,11] and this approach was used in [5].

However, to allow feasible calculations of the approximate behaviour of the Riemann Zeta function at higher values along the imaginary co-ordinate in the complex plane, the perturbed 128 tapered finite zeroth order Riemann Siegel formula is the main expression used in this paper. Firstly given the Riemann Siegel formula [12,13] and its zeroth order component using truncation at the first quiescent region $N=\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}$

\begin{align}
\zeta(s) &= R(s) + \chi(s)\cdot \bar{R}(s) \\
&\approx \sum_{k=1}^{\left(\lfloor\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}\rfloor\right)}\left(\frac{1}{k^s}\right) + \chi(s) \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{\left(\lfloor\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}\rfloor\right)}\left(\frac{1}{k^{(1-s)}}\right) \qquad \text{to zeroth order}
\end{align}

where (i) $R(s) = \sum_{k=1}^{\left(\lfloor\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}\rfloor\right)}\left(\frac{1}{k^s}\right) + \text{remainder terms}$, (ii) the remainder terms can be expressed as an expansion series [12,13] which may be divergent and (iii) $\chi(s)$ is obtained from the functional equation [5-8,12,13] for the Riemann Zeta function

\begin{equation}
\zeta(s) = \chi(s) \cdot \zeta(1-s) 
\end{equation}

Given the above formulae, it is straightforward to derive a tapered finite zeroth order Riemann Siegel function approximation of the form

\begin{align}
\zeta(s,\alpha)_{\text{pert}} &\approx \left\{1 + \alpha \cdot \left [ \sum_{k=2}^{\left(\lfloor\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}\rfloor-p\right)}\left(\frac{1}{k^s}\right) +
\sum_{i=\left(-p+1\right)}^{p}\frac{\frac{1}{2^{2p}} \left( 2^{2p}-\sum_{k=0}^{i+p-1}\binom{2p}{2p-k}\right)}{(\lfloor\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}\rfloor+i)^s} \right ] \right\} \nonumber \\ &+ \chi(s) \cdot \left\{ 1 + \alpha \cdot \left [ \sum_{k=2}^{\left(\lfloor\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}\rfloor-p\right)}\left(\frac{1}{k^{(1-s)}}\right) +
\sum_{i=\left(-p+1\right)}^{p}\frac{\frac{1}{2^{2p}} \left( 2^{2p}-\sum_{k=0}^{i+p-1}\binom{2p}{2p-k}\right)}{(\lfloor\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}\rfloor+i)^{(1-s)}} \right ]\right\} \qquad \text{as } t \rightarrow \infty \label {eq:pertubationONEtaperedzerothRS} 
\end{align}

where 2p=128 (for 128 point tapering) is used in this paper. The advantage of using the zeroth order expression for the Riemann Siegel function approximation is to simplify the calculation of first and second order derivatives for execution of the non-trivial zero quadrature search under the perturbation parameter ($\alpha$).




## Results - Examples of non-trivial zero behaviour under equation (7) perturbation, approximating equation (1) away from the real axis (e.g., imag(s) > 26000), about large Riemann Zeta peaks of the 128 point tapered finite Riemann Siegel formula 

All the calculations of non-trivial zero locations for the tapered finite zeroth Riemann Siegel function at the first quiescent region (and the finite Riemann Siegel dirichlet series at the second quiescent region) were performed using the pari-gp language [14] as a solution to second order taylor series in real(s) and imag(s) that produces iterative fourth order polynomials for imag(t) and then real(s) respectively. To test and improve code performance and conduct longer searches at higher t intervals the CoCalc platform [15] using pari-gp language was employed. References used for information include, [16-18] on the location of large Riemann peaks and nearby zeroes and [10,11,19] on Rosser rule violations for the Riemann Zeta function to identify starting values for pari-gp calculations. The R language [20] and R-studio IDE [21] were used to piece the pari-gp based results together and produce graphs.

Figures 1,3,5,7,9 display examples of the trajectory of the perturbed location of non-trivial zeroes associated near known large Riemann Zeta function peaks at t={363991205.178, 673297382.184, 1387123309.985, 2381374874120.454, 4257232978148261.802} respectively, which have peak heights Z={114, 123, 148, 368, 855}. 

Figures 1,3,5,7,9 have two panels, 
\begin{itemize}
\item The upper panel displays the real(s) versus imag(s) co-ordinate trajectory of nearby non-trivial zeroes as the perturbation varies from $0.005 < \alpha < 1$ where $\alpha=1$ represent zero perturbation. As a guide on the upper panel are vertical lines indicating the expected imaginary co-ordinate of the zeroes if Gram's law were perfectly obeyed. Under high perturbation $\alpha=0.001$ when the Riemann Zeta function contribution is a heavily reduced the imaginary component of the non-trivial zeroes generally head towards these vertical line co-ordinates. 
\item The lower panel displays the real(s) versus $\alpha$ co-ordinate trajectory of nearby non-trivial zeroes as the perturbation varies from $0.005 < \alpha < 1$. 
\end{itemize}

Figures 2,4,6,8,10 display the S(1/2+it) values of the 128 point tapered finite Riemann Siegel formula near these known large Riemann Zeta function peaks at t={363991205.178, 673297382.184, 1387123309.985, 2381374874120.454, 4257232978148261.802}. Overlayed on these figures is the signed trajectory of the perturbed location of non-trivial zeroes (for $0.005 < \alpha < 1$) in order to see if graphically there is any consistent behaviour between the S(1/2+it) values and the non-trivial zero perturbation trajectories. A signed trajectory just means that if a S(1/2+it) discontinuity has positive (negative) value then the associated non-trivial zero trajectory has a positive (negative) sign assigned (using a $\pm1$ multiplicative factor). This overlay helps visualise that the graphical evidence of a particular non-trivial zero perturbation trajectory behaviour when |S(1/2+it)| > 1.7.

Located just above figures 2,4,6,8,10 are simple tables comparing known (LMFDB [18]) values of Gram points, Riemann Zeta zeroes co-ordinates and 128 point tapered finite Riemann Siegel formula (using first quiescent region) zeroes co-ordinates for the displayed non-trivial zeroes in the nearby figures. In particular, the 128 point tapered finite Riemann Siegel formula (using first quiescent region) zeroes co-ordinates exhibit less accuracy for closely spaced zeroes but the accuracy is generally to the 3rd decimal place (given 9+ significant digits). (In the appendix, the 128 taper finite Dirichlet Series (using second quiescent region) zeroes co-ordinates are also provided for the first three Rosser rule violation points and the observed accuracy is higher as expected.) 

Figure 1 displays the behaviour of twelve low-lying non-trivial zeroes for $0.005 < \alpha < 1$ for equation (7) perturbation near the large peak [16] at t=363991205.1788358 of the Riemann Zeta function. It can be observed that under perturbation equation (7), the Riemann Zeta non-trivial zeroes located at t=363991204.427948... (gram point 977571899) and t=363991206.013777... (gram point 977571902) overshoot the critical line to reach real(s)~0.68 when $\alpha$~0.25 finally settling back to real(s)=0.5 when $\alpha=1$ changing the sequence of the non-trivial zeroes. Under high perturbation $\alpha=0.001$ when the Riemann Zeta function contribution is a heavily reduced the imaginary component of the non-trivial zeroes generally head towards these vertical line co-ordinates but the inner zeroes closest to the Riemann Zeta function peak clearly take longer to approach the Gram's law expected zeroes co-ordinates. The upper panel shows the complex plane \{imag(s),real(s)\} trajectory of the non-trivial zero under the perturbation while the lower panel shows the \{$\alpha$, real(s)\} trajectory. 

Figure 2 displays the behaviour of (the 128 point tapered finite Riemann Siegel formula) S(1/2+it) function values for the Riemann Zeta zeroes near the large peak at t=363991205.1788358 of the Riemann Zeta function. Comparing the signed trajectory (red lines) of the non-trivial zeroes under perturbation equation (7) to the S(1/2+it) values provides preliminary evidence that the non-trivial zero trajectories that overshoot their Gram point order are associated with S(1/2+it) function values > 1.7

Figure 3 displays the behaviour of twelve low-lying non-trivial zeroes for $0.005 < \alpha < 1$ for equation (7) perturbation near the large peak [16] at t=673297382.184 of the Riemann Zeta function. It can be observed that under perturbation equation (7), the Riemann Zeta non-trivial zeroes located at t=673297382.9696185... (gram point 1874184807) overshoots the critical line to reach real(s)~0.65 when $\alpha$~0.25 finally settling back to real(s)=0.5 when $\alpha=1$ changing the sequence of the non-trivial zeroes. Under high perturbation $\alpha=0.001$ when the Riemann Zeta function contribution is a heavily reduced the imaginary component of the non-trivial zeroes generally head towards these vertical line co-ordinates but the inner zeroes closest to the Riemann Zeta function peak clearly take longer to approach the Gram's law expected zeroes co-ordinates. The upper panel shows the complex plane \{imag(s),real(s)\} trajectory of the non-trivial zero under the perturbation while the lower panel shows the \{$\alpha$, real(s)\} trajectory. The empirical observation that only a zero on the upper side of the peak exhibit overshoot on perturbation equation (7) provides a useful counterexample to figure 1. 

Figure 4 displays the behaviour of (the 128 point tapered finite Riemann Siegel formula) S(1/2+it) function values for the Riemann Zeta zeroes near the large peak at t=673297382.184 of the Riemann Zeta function. Comparing the signed trajectory (red lines) of the non-trivial zeroes under perturbation equation (7) to the S(1/2+it) values provides preliminary evidence that the non-trivial zero trajectories that overshoot their Gram point order are associated with S(1/2+it) function values > 1.7. The observation that the two zeroes on the lower side of the peak have |S|<1.7 and don't exhibit overshoot in the perturbation equation (7) behaviour helps establish an clear association about the viability of the proposed |S| threshold and observed perturbation equation (7) behaviour.

Figure 5 displays the behaviour of twelve low-lying non-trivial zeroes for $0.005 < \alpha < 1$ for equation (7) perturbation near the large peak [16] at t=1387123309.985 of the Riemann Zeta function. It can be observed that under perturbation equation (7), the Riemann Zeta non-trivial zeroes located at t=1387123309.2256571... (gram point 4020755338) and t=1387123310.7835436... (gram point 4020755341) overshoot the critical line to reach real(s)~0.65, 0.67 respectively when $\alpha$~0.25 finally settling back to real(s)=0.5 when $\alpha=1$ changing the sequence of the non-trivial zeroes. Under high perturbation $\alpha=0.001$ when the Riemann Zeta function contribution is a heavily reduced the imaginary component of the non-trivial zeroes generally head towards these vertical line co-ordinates but the inner zeroes closest to the Riemann Zeta function peak clearly take longer to approach the Gram's law expected zeroes co-ordinates. The upper panel shows the complex plane \{imag(s),real(s)\} trajectory of the non-trivial zero under the perturbation while the lower panel shows the \{$\alpha$, real(s)\} trajectory. 

Figure 6 displays the behaviour of (the 128 point tapered finite Riemann Siegel formula) S(1/2+it) function values for the Riemann Zeta zeroes near the large peak at t=1387123309.985 of the Riemann Zeta function. Comparing the signed trajectory (red lines) of the non-trivial zeroes under perturbation equation (7) to the S(1/2+it) values provides ongoing evidence that the non-trivial zero trajectories that overshoot their Gram point order are associated with S(1/2+it) function values > 1.7

Figure 7 displays the behaviour of twelve low-lying non-trivial zeroes for $0.005 < \alpha < 1$ for equation (7) perturbation near the large peak [16] at t=2381374874120.454 of the Riemann Zeta function. It can be observed that under perturbation equation (7), the Riemann Zeta non-trivial zeroes located at t=2381374874119.853140... and t=2381374874121.057263... overshoot the critical line to reach real(s)~0.67, 0.68 respectively when $\alpha$~0.25 finally settling back to real(s)=0.5 when $\alpha=1$ changing the sequence of the non-trivial zeroes. Under high perturbation $\alpha=0.001$ when the Riemann Zeta function contribution is a heavily reduced the imaginary component of the non-trivial zeroes generally head towards these vertical line co-ordinates but the inner zeroes closest to the Riemann Zeta function peak clearly take longer to approach the Gram's law expected zeroes co-ordinates. The upper panel shows the complex plane \{imag(s),real(s)\} trajectory of the non-trivial zero under the perturbation while the lower panel shows the \{$\alpha$, real(s)\} trajectory.

Comparing the signed trajectory (red lines) of the non-trivial zeroes under perturbation equation (7) to the S(1/2+it) values provides ongoing evidence that the non-trivial zero trajectories that overshoot their Gram point order are associated with S(1/2+it) function values > 1.7

***Figure 8. Comparing signed trajectory of 128 taper zeroth order Riemann Siegel function Dirichlet Series under simple perturbation (red lines) and 128 taper zeroth order Riemann Siegel function argument function (S values).***

\newpage

Figure 9 displays the behaviour of twelve low-lying non-trivial zeroes for $0.005 < \alpha < 1$ for equation (7) perturbation near the large peak [17] at t=4257232978148261.802 of the Riemann Zeta function. It can be observed that under perturbation equation (7), the Riemann Zeta non-trivial zeroes located at t=4257232978148261.305478... and t=4257232978148262.236684... both overshoot (by two zero positions) the critical line to reach real(s)~0.70, 0.68 respectively when $\alpha$~0.2 finally settling back to real(s)=0.5 when $\alpha=1$ changing the sequence of the non-trivial zeroes. Under high perturbation $\alpha=0.001$ when the Riemann Zeta function contribution is a heavily reduced the imaginary component of the non-trivial zeroes generally head towards these vertical line co-ordinates but the inner zeroes closest to the Riemann Zeta function peak clearly take longer to approach the Gram's law expected zeroes co-ordinates. The upper panel shows the complex plane \{imag(s),real(s)\} trajectory of the non-trivial zero under the perturbation while the lower panel shows the \{$\alpha$, real(s)\} trajectory. 

Figure 10 displays the behaviour of (the 128 point tapered finite Riemann Siegel formula) S(1/2+it) function values for the Riemann Zeta zeroes near the large peak at t=4257232978148261.802 of the Riemann Zeta function. Comparing the signed trajectory (red lines) of the non-trivial zeroes under perturbation equation (7) to the S(1/2+it) values provides useful additional evidence that the non-trivial zero trajectories that overshoot their Gram point order are associated with S(1/2+it) function values > 1.7, since there are four Riemann Zeta zeroes with $|S| \gtrsim 1.7$ two on each side of the peak (due to the large size of the peak, height = 855 [17]).

## Conclusions

Perturbing the dirichlet coefficients of the 128 tapered zeroth order Riemann Siegel function about the first quiescient region of its dirichlet series using equation (7) can provide useful insights into the origin and behaviour of non-trivial zeroes of the Riemann Zeta function. A similar investigation will be attempted for large peaks of 5 periodic Davenport Heilbron functions.

## Appendix - Second quiescent region based calculations of non-trivial zero trajectory under simple perturbation

In figure A1-A3, the non-trivial zero behaviour of the 128 tapered Riemann Zeta Dirichlet series (truncated at the second quiescent region $N=\frac{t}{\pi}$) under simple perturbation, nearby the first three Rosser rule violations (gram points n=13999525, 30783329, 30930929) is also shown to move the ordering of the non-trivial zeroes when the argument function magnitude $S \gtrsim 1.7$. Where the tapered Riemann Zeta Dirichlet series truncated at the second quiescent region $N=\frac{t}{\pi}$ is a closer approximation of the Riemann Zeta function than the tapered zeroth order Rieman Siegel function truncated at the first quiescent region $N=\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}$.

For visual comparison only, signed perturbation trajectories of the 128 tapered Riemann Zeta Dirichlet series (truncated at the second quiescent region $N=\frac{t}{\pi}$) shown as red lines are used in figures A1-A3, whereby the pertubation trajectories of the non-trivial zeroes under perturbation have inverted magnitudes (i.e., a -1 multiplicative factor is applied) so that the red trajectory lines appear with the same sign as the S value lineshapes (produced using 128 taper zeroth order Riemann Siegel function).

Figure A1 displays the behaviour of five low-lying non-trivial zeroes for $0.005 < \alpha < 1$ for equation (7) perturbation near the second Rosser rule violation (gram point number 13999525, t=6820050.0586698...) of the Riemann Zeta function. It can be observed that under perturbation equation (7), the Riemann Zeta non-trivial zero located at t=6820052.0041220... (gram point 13999528) overshoots the critical line to reach real(s)~0.689 when $\alpha$~0.5 finally settling back to real(s)=0.5 when $\alpha=1$ changing the sequence of the non-trivial zeroes. The overshoot trajectory is associated with |S|=-2.004138 for the Riemann Zeta function zero [10].

Figure A2 displays the behaviour of five low-lying non-trivial zeroes for $0.005 < \alpha < 1$ for equation (7) perturbation near the second Rosser rule violation (gram point number 30783329, t=14190356.9683576...) of the Riemann Zeta function. It can be observed that under perturbation equation (7), the Riemann Zeta non-trivial zero located at t=14190358.8694475... (gram point 30783332) overshoots the critical line to reach real(s)~0.689 when $\alpha$~0.5 finally settling back to real(s)=0.5 when $\alpha=1$ changing the sequence of the non-trivial zeroes. The overshoot trajectory is associated with |S|=-2.00594 for the Riemann Zeta function zero [10].

Figure A3 displays the behaviour of seven low-lying non-trivial zeroes for $0.005 < \alpha < 1$ for equation (7) perturbation near the third Rosser rule violation (gram point number 30930927, t=14253736.0289697...) of the Riemann Zeta function. It can be observed that under perturbation equation (7), the Riemann Zeta non-trivial zero located at t=14253736.6001908... (gram point 30930930) overshoots the critical line to reach real(s)~0.68 when $\alpha$~0.45 finally settling back to real(s)=0.5 when $\alpha=1$ changing the sequence of the non-trivial zeroes. The overshoot trajectory is associated with |S|=+2.050625 for the Riemann Zeta function zero [10].

So for the first three Rosser rule violation locations it is observed that a nearby non-trivial zero that initially heavily overshoots the critical line before settling back to the critical line as $\alpha \rightarrow 1$. For these Rosser rule violation locations and the evidence gathered for higher peaks in figures 1-10, the sequence of the non-trivial zeroes appears to change going from a low symmetry dirichlet series to a higher symmetry dirichlet series when $|S| \gtrsim 1.7$ of a Riemann Zeta function zero.

\newpage

central value of peak as determined by Gram point behaviour $\Theta(t)/\pi = n \in \mathbb{Z}$

Note, that the approximate centre of the peak based on central point of S function at imag(s)=14253737.175, near the second Rosser point does not closely follow the above behaviour (see n value below).
