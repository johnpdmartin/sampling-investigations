# sampling-investigations

This directory contains results from sampling and simulations using R programming

1. Median estimation: Suitably transforming the reference frame for jackknife variance estimation can improve jackknife variance estimates of median confidence intervals and get good agreement with bootstrap estimates.  
2. Synthetic Research: Investigation of suitable A/B sampling sizes based on public data about Zulily customer base. This report is a synthetic construction of a customer base using public data describing high level numbers for the size of the customer base and the relative behaviour (purchases per year) of new and old customers. The intent was to see if internal structure of large customner bases could impact on confidence intervals of A/B samplimng estimates. As demonstrated stratified sampling can decrease the confidence interval of estimates.
